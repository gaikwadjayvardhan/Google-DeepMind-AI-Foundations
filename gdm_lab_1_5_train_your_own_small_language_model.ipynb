In the case of the language model you will be training, each paragraph from the Africa Galore dataset constitutes an example. The input should therefore be a matrix that has the IDs of every token in a paragraph. In this matrix, the first entry of a row should be the ID of the first token, the second entry should be the ID of the second token, the third entry should be the ID of the third token, and so on.\n",

        ">There are two common solutions to this problem:\n",
        ">1. You can use a special `<PAD>` token to ensure that all sequences have the same length. This way, you can pad shorter paragraphs to match the length of the longest paragraph. This is done by adding `<PAD>` tokens at the beginning or the end of the paragraph. This results in all paragraphs having exactly the same length so that they can be combined in one matrix.\n",
        ">2. Another option is to truncate paragraphs. That is, removing the tokens at the beginning or the end of a paragraph so that they have the length of the shortest paragraph. This, however, may remove a lot of information from the dataset. For example, if the shortest paragraph has only five tokens, then you would shorten every paragraph to five tokens and remove almost all tokens.\n",
        ">\n",
        "> It is also possible to combine both of these methods so that you choose a target length. That way, very long paragraphs that exceed this length are truncated and short paragraphs whose length is below the target length are padded.\n",

That is because the transformer always needs at least one token as input, so it will start by predicting the next word.\n",

Furthermore, there is often some order in your data. For example, in the Africa Galore dataset, all examples concerning food appear one after each other. When training a model, however, it is generally best to include a very diverse set of paragraphs in one batch. This can be achieved by **shuffling** the data in the dataset so that all paragraphs appear in random order before splitting them up into batches. Note that the order of tokens within a paragraph must remain intact since you would end up with word puzzles otherwise.\n",

If you set the batch size too large, you may get \"out of memory\" errors that indicate that you do not have enough memory available to train the model. You will learn more about dealing with methods for reducing memory in later courses.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Padded the paragraphs:** You ensured all paragraphs had the same length by truncating some of them and padding others with a special `\"<PAD>\"` token. This is crucial for processing data in neural networks, such as transformer language models.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Prepared the input and target data:** You created input-target pairs, where the target is the input sequence shifted by one token. This teaches the model to predict the next token based on the context of previous tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Shuffled and batched the data:** You shuffled the dataset to increase the diversity of the data within each batch and grouped the paragraphs into batches for training.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Trained the SLM:** You defined and trained a small transformer model, observing how the training loss decreased during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Prompted the trained model:** You experimented with prompting the model, observing its ability to predict the likely next word, generate coherent text, and adapt to changes in context.\n",
        "\n",
        "As you performed your evaluations, you may have noticed that some of the model predictions are not as good as the ones that you have seen with the Gemma model. This is expected since your model is a lot smaller than the Gemma model. It has been trained on *a lot* less text data. Nevertheless, your model should be able to produce grammatical sentences, even if they do not always make a lot of sense.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the next section of the course, you will explore model evaluation in a little more depth. You will then move on to think about the kinds of problems you are interested in using language models to address."
